# Power Pages Integration with .NET Web API

## Overview

This project provides a template for integrating **Microsoft Power Pages** with a **.NET-based Web API**. While Power Pages is a powerful low-code platform for building external-facing websites using Dataverse, there are limitations when it comes to server-side logic, custom operations, and connecting to external services. This template addresses those gaps by enabling pro-code extensibility using .NET APIs.

## Why Use .NET APIs with Power Pages?

Power Pages offer great capabilities with tools like:

- Entity Lists
- Basic & Multi-Step Forms
- Liquid Templates
- JavaScript & jQuery

However, some advanced scenarios require more power than low-code tools can provide. Here are a few reasons to use this template:

- **Custom Backend Logic:** Perform complex actions server-side not possible with JavaScript or Power Automate.
- **Secure External Integrations:** Call external services like SharePoint using app-only tokens.
- **Bypass Web API Limitations:** The Power Pages Web API does not support unbound actions or batch (transactional) requests.
- **Reuse of Dataverse Security Model:** Power Pages automatically apply Dataverse security (table permissions), even with API interactions.

## Key Features

- üîó **External API Integration:** Connect Power Pages securely with external services through your custom .NET API.
- üîê **Token Authentication:** Example includes secure token exchange between Power Pages and your API. 
- üöÄ **Quick Start for Pro Developers:** Ideal for developers looking to extend Power Pages functionality using C#.
